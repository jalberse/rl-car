General TODO
- Implement eligibility traces
- Implement heuristic
- Script to load Q and display it running on the track

Experimental Components
- Experiment 1
	- Hypothesis: Q-learning with replacing traces will learn more quickly than pure Q-learning.
	- 5 runs straight Q-learning
	- 5 runs with replacing traces
- Experiment 2
	- Hypothesis: Guiding exploration with a heuristic will improve learning speed.
	- 5 runs without heuristic
	- 5 runs with heuristic
